# Demo Steps
1. Create the ECS Cluster for Lambda
2. Define a task using the image above
   - Be sure to select ARM (it seems to work better with the image)
3. Create a service
  - Be sure to set the right security group
  - Be sure to select load balancing and target the load balancer created (and the target group)
  - Be sure to set autoscaling using mostly default values

4. While service is starting up, go to the load balancer target group and show no entries - 
   or perhaps just the one newly started
5. When the task has started, hit the load balancer :
